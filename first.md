Customer Behavior Monitoring

As a product owner, I want to track and analyze user engagement metrics so that I can understand how users interact with our app and make data-driven decisions to improve the user experience.

1.	The system should be able to track the following key user engagement metrics:
•	Session length: Duration of each user's interaction with the app.
•	Frequency of use: How often users open and interact with the app.
•	Features used: Identify which features of the app users engage with the most.
•	Navigation paths: Understand the typical user journey within the app.
2.	All the tracked data should be timestamped and tied to a unique user ID, allowing for individual user behavior analysis.
3.	The system should provide a user-friendly dashboard where the product team can view and analyze these metrics.
4.	The dashboard should include capabilities to filter and segment data based on relevant parameters (e.g., time period, user demographics, device type).


App Performance Monitoring

As a product owner, I want a performance monitoring system integrated into our app so that I can ensure our app is responsive and provides a smooth user experience.
1.	The system should be able to track the following performance metrics:
•	App load time: The time taken from when a user launches the app until the app is fully loaded and ready to interact with.
•	Screen rendering time: The time taken for a screen to fully render after a user navigates to it.
•	Network latency: The delay in the app's communication over the network, particularly for key actions that rely on network requests.
2.	All the tracked data should be timestamped and tied to a unique user ID and session ID, allowing us to identify if specific users or sessions are experiencing performance issues.
3.	The system should provide real-time alerts when performance metrics exceed defined thresholds.
4.	The system should provide a user-friendly dashboard where the product team can view and analyze these metrics.
5.	The dashboard should include the ability to filter and segment data based on relevant parameters (e.g., time period, user demographics, device type).

Network Monitoring

As a product owner, I want to monitor the network performance of our app to ensure optimal user experience, identify connectivity issues, and improve the app's robustness under varying network conditions.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.	The system should be able to monitor and record details about the network status when users are interacting with the app. This should include information about the type of network (e.g., WiFi, 4G, 5G) and its quality (e.g., speed, latency).
2.	The system should track how the network performance impacts key functions and tasks within the app, particularly those that rely heavily on network connectivity.
3.	The system should be able to identify when network-related issues are causing slow performance or failures in the app.
4.	The system should provide real-time alerts when network issues are detected.
5.	The system should provide a user-friendly dashboard where the product team can view and analyze these metrics.
6.	The dashboard should allow for data filtering and segmentation based on relevant parameters (e.g., time period, user demographics, device type).

Device-Level Insights


User Story:
As a product owner, I want to obtain device-level insights from our app usage to ensure that the app provides a consistent and smooth experience across different devices and operating systems.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.	The system should be able to record and track the device type and operating system version for each user session. This includes the device brand, model, and screen resolution, as well as the OS type and version.
2.	The system should track how app performance and user engagement metrics vary across different devices and operating systems.
3.	The system should provide alerts when notable issues or significant performance variations are detected on specific device types or operating systems.
4.	The system should provide a user-friendly dashboard where the product team can view and analyze these metrics.
5.	The dashboard should include the ability to filter and segment data based on relevant parameters (e.g., time period, user demographics, device type).


API Monitoring

User Story:
As a product owner, I want to monitor the performance and availability of the APIs our app relies on, so that I can ensure the app's functionality and user experience are not compromised by API issues.

Acceptance Criteria:
1.	The system should be able to monitor the status, response times, and error rates of all API calls made by the app.
2.	The system should provide real-time alerts when API performance issues or errors are detected. This should include details such as the specific API endpoint, the nature of the issue (e.g., slow response, failure), and the impact on the app's functionality.
3.	The system should record and provide reports on API performance trends over time, helping identify any persistent issues or opportunities for optimization.
4.	The system should provide a user-friendly dashboard where the product team can view and analyze these metrics.
5.	The dashboard should include the ability to filter and segment data based on relevant parameters (e.g., time period, specific API endpoints).
